# Analysis of the Most Influential Factors on Life Expectancy using ML

Please refer to the file **"Analysis of the Most Influential Factors on Life Expectancy using ML Translation.pdf"** to see an English version of the work.

## Project Structure

This project is divided into the different steps that took place:

### CSV Transformations Folder
- Original data and code for the alteration of the original data to adapt it into a standardized format.

### Data Folder
- **CSVs**: Individual files containing the factors and data to be used in the project.
- **Datasets**: United, treated, and preprocessed datasets containing all the data to be used.
- **Genetics Results**: Results on the use of the genetic algorithm.
- **Models**: Saved machine learning models.
- **Scalers**: Scalers used for the transformation of the data for normalization.

### Steps and Code
1. **Dataset Merging**  
   Code to merge the different individual data into one cohesive dataset.
   
2. **Analysis and Preprocessing**  
   Analysis of the different data used and the transformations applied to make it usable for modeling.

3. **Models v1 and v2**  
   Machine Learning models trained with the preprocessed data using different approaches, strategies, and architectures.

4. **Genetics NN**  
   Use of the Genetic algorithm to identify the most influential factors on life expectancy.

5. **Predictor**  
   Inference of the final model that, given the data of one country, will predict the life expectancy. Also, includes analysis of the model behavior using SHAP additive values.

### Additional Files
